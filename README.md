The class NoIdCursorWrapper is the work of jromanda@gmail.com . you'll need to contact him for license until I get clearance to release this work on his behalf.

The OrmliteCursorAdapter is based off of logic from https://github.com/sosiouxme/Android-examples thanks to luke.rt.meyer@gmail.com

Contact myself for license information on the rest of the code.
